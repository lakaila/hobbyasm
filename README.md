# hobbyasm - Some hobby assembly

This is a repository for some assembly code.
Just for fun. I'll start with "wc" and see
if more gets done.

* Targeting Linux
* First 32-bit ARM code (64-bit later)
* GNU toolchain (as,ld,gcc)
* Not intented to be actually used
* If it doesn't "make" then it's not work
